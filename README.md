Just my open source projects... If you find joy in building large analytical systems, then our sense of fun might be similar... In that case, welcome.

Also, all the code used here is prohibited from being used for commercial purposes. If you like this project and want to create something interesting, feel free to contact me — I’ll be glad to hear from you.
